Random Fortune Cookie Generator

Description:
This Python project implements a simple fortune cookie generator using the random.randint() function. With each run, it generates a random lucky number between 1 and 100 and selects a fortune message from a pool of three possibilities. The fortune messages range from optimistic predictions of having a great day to more whimsical predictions like getting married within the year. This project serves as a fun and light-hearted way to start your day with a random fortune!
